# Description
In this part of the project the data is further preprocessed, and some features are enginered. then data is seperated into train and test sets. different models was tried
and random forest regression is selected. Two seperate models are created one for house 
type property and the other for apartment. The test score of the apartment model is 73.6%
and that of house is 59%. 




## step 1 Data cleaning.

Preprocess the data to be used with machine learning:

- handled NANs
- handled categorical data
- You normalize continuous data
- You have to remove features that have too strong correlation removed
- select relevant features for your model

Then you will need to select a model, train, test and evaluate it on your dataset.

### step 2 Data formating

- Divide dataset for training and testing. (`X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, `y_test`)

#### Step 3 Modeling training and evaluation

 - model is created 
 - model is trained and evaluated
